SevenSegmentDisplay
Author: Yati Sagade
Desc:   A small Python library that emulates a 7-segment display using
		pygame. Highly customizable displays can be built, or in other
		words, this is heavily over-engineered due to lack of any important
		tasks at hand at the point this was written :)

sevensegment.py contains the actual code - very easy to read and follow
