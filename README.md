# PyGame Seven Segment Display

This repo is a fork of [this one](https://github.com/yati-sagade/SevenSegmentDisplay).

I've updated it to work with Python 3 and added the functionality that I required at the time


# Original README contents:

SevenSegmentDisplay

Author: Yati Sagade

Desc:   A small Python library that emulates a 7-segment display using
		pygame. Highly customizable displays can be built, or in other
		words, this is heavily over-engineered due to lack of any important
		tasks at hand at the point this was written :)

sevensegment.py contains the actual code - very easy to read and follow
